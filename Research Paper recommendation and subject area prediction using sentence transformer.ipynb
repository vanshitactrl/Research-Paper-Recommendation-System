More notably, GNNs are vulnerable to\\nprivacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks, even if only blackbox\\naccess to the trained model is granted. To build defenses, differential privacy\\nhas emerged as a mechanism to disguise the sensitive data in training datasets.\\nFollowing the strategy of Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE),\\nrecent methods leverage a large ensemble of teacher models.

However, the lack of transparency and\\naccountability of most accurate models often hinders their safe use. Thus,\\nthere is a clear need for developing explainable artificial intelligence\\nmechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize feature\\ncontributions, but their interpretability is limited to predictions made by\\nblack-box models.

More notably, GNNs are vulnerable to\\nprivacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks, even if only blackbox\\naccess to the trained model is granted. To build defenses, differential privacy\\nhas emerged as a mechanism to disguise the sensitive data in training datasets.\\nFollowing the strategy of Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE),\\nrecent methods leverage a large ensemble of teacher models. These teachers are\\ntrained on disjoint subsets of private data and are employed to transfer\\nknowledge to a student model, which is then released with privacy guarantees.\\nHowever, splitting graph data into many disjoint training sets may destroy the\\nstructural information and adversely affect accuracy. We propose a new\\ngraph-specific scheme of releasing a student GNN, which avoids splitting\\nprivate training data altogether. The student GNN is trained using public data,\\npartly labeled privately using the teacher GNN models trained exclusively for\\neach query node. We theoretically analyze our approach in the R\\`{e}nyi\\ndifferential privacy framework and provide privacy guarantees. Besides, we show\\nthe solid experimental performance of our method compared to several baselines,\\nincluding the PATE baseline adapted for graph-structured data. Our anonymized\\ncode is available.  \n",

However, the lack of transparency and\\naccountability of most accurate models often hinders their safe use. Thus,\\nthere is a clear need for developing explainable artificial intelligence\\nmechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize feature\\ncontributions, but their interpretability is limited to predictions made by\\nblack-box models. An open challenge is to develop models that have intrinsic\\ninterpretability and produce their own explanations, even for classes of models\\nthat are traditionally considered black boxes like (recurrent) neural networks.\\nIn this paper, we propose a Long-Term Cognitive Network for interpretable\\npattern classification of structured data. Our method brings its own mechanism\\nfor providing explanations by quantifying the relevance of each feature in the\\ndecision process. For supporting the interpretability without affecting the\\nperformance, the model incorporates more flexibility through a quasi-nonlinear\\nreasoning rule that allows controlling nonlinearity. Besides, we propose a\\nrecurrence-aware decision model that evades the issues posed by unique fixed\\npoints while introducing a deterministic learning method to compute the tunable\\nparameters. The simulations show that our interpretable model obtains\\ncompetitive results when compared to the state-of-the-art white and black-box\\nmodels.  "

Leveraging large training sets and extensive computing resources,\\nrecent work has shown that GANs can be trained to generate synthetic imagery\\nwhich is (in some ways) indistinguishable from real imagery. We analyze the\\nstructure of the generating network of a popular GAN implementation, and show\\nthat the network's treatment of color is markedly different from a real camera\\nin two ways. We further show that these two cues can be used to distinguish\\nGAN-generated imagery from camera imagery, demonstrating effective\\ndiscrimination between GAN imagery and real camera images used to train the\\nGAN.\"\n",

      "Abstract: b'Recent studies have witnessed that self-supervised methods based on view\\nsynthesis obtain clear progress on multi-view stereo (MVS). However, existing\\nmethods rely on the assumption that the corresponding points among different\\nviews share the same color, which may not always be true in practice. This may\\nlead to unreliable self-supervised signal and harm the final reconstruction\\nperformance. To address the issue, we propose a framework integrated with more\\nreliable supervision guided by semantic co-segmentation and data-augmentation.\\nSpecially, we excavate mutual semantic from multi-view images to guide the\\nsemantic consistency. And we devise effective data-augmentation mechanism which\\nensures the transformation robustness by treating the prediction of regular\\nsamples as pseudo ground truth to regularize the prediction of augmented\\nsamples. Experimental results on DTU dataset show that our proposed methods\\nachieve the state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods, and even\\ncompete on par with supervised methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments on\\nTanks&Temples dataset demonstrate the effective generalization ability of the\\nproposed method.'\n",

      "Abstract: b'Biometric presentation attack detection is gaining increasing attention.\\nUsers of mobile devices find it more convenient to unlock their smart\\napplications with finger, face or iris recognition instead of passwords. In\\nthis paper, we survey the approaches presented in the recent literature to\\ndetect face and iris presentation attacks. Specifically, we investigate the\\neffectiveness of fine tuning very deep convolutional neural networks to the\\ntask of face and iris antispoofing. We compare two different fine tuning\\napproaches on six publicly available benchmark datasets. Results show the\\neffectiveness of these deep models in learning discriminative features that can\\ntell apart real from fake biometric images with very low error rate.\\nCross-dataset evaluation on face PAD showed better generalization than state of\\nthe art. We also performed cross-dataset testing on iris PAD datasets in terms\\nof equal error rate which was not reported in literature before. Additionally,\\nwe propose the use of a single deep network trained to detect both face and\\niris attacks. We have not noticed accuracy degradation compared to networks\\ntrained for only one biometric separately. Finally, we analyzed the learned\\nfeatures by the network, in correlation with the image frequency components, to\\njustify its prediction decision.'\n",
